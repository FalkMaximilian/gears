## Architecture

gears is a **durable workflow execution engine** (similar to Temporal.io) built in Rust. The core design is event sourcing + deterministic replay: all workflow state transitions are persisted to SQLite, enabling crash recovery by replaying history.

### Execution Model

```
engine.start_workflow(name, input)
  → persists WorkflowStarted event
  → spawns WorkerTask (bounded by semaphore for concurrency limit)
    → calls Workflow::run(WorkflowContext, input)
      → ctx.execute_activity("activity_name", input)
          → on replay: returns cached result from event history
          → on new: persist ActivityScheduled → retry loop (with optional timeout) → persist ActivityCompleted/ActivityErrored
      → ctx.execute_activities_parallel(vec![("a", input), ("b", input)])
          → pre-allocates sequence_ids → runs all branches concurrently → each branch replays independently
      → ctx.concurrently(vec![branch(|ctx| async { ... }), branch(|ctx| async { ... })])
          → claims 1 fork-marker sequence_id + n × BRANCH_BUDGET (1000) IDs from main counter
          → persists ConcurrentBranchesStarted event (skipped on replay if already present)
          → creates n BranchContexts, each with its own local counter + fixed branch_base offset
          → runs all branches as concurrent tokio tasks (each receives its own BranchContext)
          → each branch uses branch_base + local_counter as sequence_id for its activities
          → fail-fast: first branch error aborts the rest; try_concurrently collects all results
          → concurrently_2/3/4 typed variants return tuples with heterogeneous output types
          → on replay: same counter state → same branch_base values → branches find cached history entries
      → ctx.sleep(duration)
          → on replay: returns immediately if TimerFired in history
          → on new: persist TimerStarted → sleep → persist TimerFired
          → on crash-recovery: recalculate remaining time from TimerStarted timestamp
      → ctx.get_version(change_id, min, max)
          → on replay: returns stored version from VersionMarker event
          → on new: persists max_version, returns it
      → ctx.register_cleanup("activity_name", input)
          → consumes a sequence_id from the same call counter as execute_activity/sleep
          → on replay: finds CleanupRegistered{sequence_id} in history → no-op
          → on new: persists CleanupRegistered event
  → WorkerTask: if result is Ok or Cancelled → run_cleanups() in LIFO order
      → for each CleanupRegistered not yet followed by CleanupCompleted/CleanupFailed:
          → look up activity by name → call activity.execute() (single attempt)
          → persist CleanupCompleted or CleanupFailed (failures tolerated, do not propagate)
      → if result is Err(other) and CleanupPolicy::Always → run_cleanups() same as above
      → if result is Err(other) and CleanupPolicy::OnSuccessOrCancelled (default) → skip cleanups
  → persist WorkflowCompleted/WorkflowCancelled (after cleanups) or WorkflowFailed + update run status
```

On engine startup, `list_running_workflows()` finds any in-progress runs and replays them from their stored event history — this is the crash-recovery path.

### Key Modules

- **`traits.rs`** — `Workflow`, `Activity`, `Storage` traits. All user-defined logic implements these.
- **`typed.rs`** — `TypedWorkflow`, `TypedActivity` traits with associated `Input`/`Output` types. Blanket impls auto-generate the untyped `Workflow`/`Activity` implementations, handling serde at the boundary.
- **`event.rs`** — `WorkflowEvent`/`EventPayload` enum — the immutable event log schema.
- **`context.rs`** — `WorkflowContext` (passed to `Workflow::run`) provides `execute_activity()`, `execute_activities_parallel()`, `concurrently()` / `try_concurrently()` / `concurrently_2/3/4()`, `sleep()`/`sleep_until()`, `get_version()`, `register_cleanup()`, cancellation support, determinism helpers (`is_replaying()`, `workflow_start_time()`), and shared workflow state (`set_shared_state`/`shared_state`). `ActivityContext` carries run metadata and optional shared state from the workflow. Maintains internal replay cache keyed by call sequence number. Activities are looked up by name from the registry. Typed convenience methods (`execute_activity_typed`, etc.) wrap the Value-based API with auto-serde. **Branch mode**: contexts spawned by `concurrently` carry a `branch_counter` + `branch_base` that replace the global `call_counter` for sequence ID allocation, keeping each branch's IDs in a fixed, non-overlapping range (`BRANCH_BUDGET = 1000` IDs per branch). The public `branch()` helper boxes closures for `concurrently`.
- **`engine.rs`** — `WorkflowEngineBuilder` + `WorkflowEngine`. Manages workflow/activity registration, dispatch loop, recovery on startup, concurrency via semaphore, `cancel_workflow()`, `list_runs()`, `workflow_names()`, `activity_names()`, cleanup policy (`cleanup_policy(CleanupPolicy)`), and typed variants (`start_workflow_typed`, `get_run_result`, `get_run_result_typed`).
- **`api.rs`** — `management_router()` returns an Axum `Router<Arc<WorkflowEngine>>` with REST endpoints for all engine management operations. Mount it with `.nest("/api", management_router())`. Endpoints: `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}`, `POST /runs/{id}/cancel`, `GET /schedules`, `POST /schedules`, `DELETE /schedules/{name}`, `POST /schedules/{name}/pause`, `POST /schedules/{name}/resume`, `GET /workflows`, `GET /activities`.
- **`worker.rs`** — `WorkerTask` executes a single workflow run end-to-end. Runs registered cleanups (LIFO, failures tolerated) before writing `WorkflowCompleted` or `WorkflowCancelled`. With `CleanupPolicy::Always`, also runs cleanups before `WorkflowFailed`. Defines `CleanupPolicy` enum.
- **`storage/sqlite.rs`** — SQLite backend (WAL mode). Two tables: `workflow_runs` (metadata + status) and `workflow_events` (append-only event log).
- **`metrics.rs`** — Optional metrics instrumentation behind the `metrics` Cargo feature.
- **`error.rs`** — `GearsError` enum covering storage, serialization, execution, cancellation, and engine lifecycle errors. Specific variants for `ActivityTimedOut`, `VersionConflict`, `TaskPanicked`, `InvalidSchedule`, `RunNotFound`, `ScheduleNotFound`, `BranchBudgetExceeded`; `Other(String)` is reserved for truly unexpected errors.
- **`src/bin/gears-ctl/`** — Standalone TUI controller binary (`gears-ctl`). Connects to the management API over HTTP. Four files: `main.rs` (event loop, terminal setup), `app.rs` (state + actions), `client.rs` (reqwest API client), `ui.rs` (ratatui rendering). Key bindings: `Tab` switch tab, `↑↓` navigate, `c` cancel run, `p` pause/resume schedule, `d` delete schedule, `r` refresh, `q` quit.

### Deterministic Replay Invariant

Workflow functions must be **deterministic and side-effect free** — all I/O must go through `ctx.execute_activity()` or `ctx.sleep()`. The replay mechanism uses `sequence_id` (atomic counter) to match history entries to the current call position. Introducing non-determinism (e.g., random values, system time) inside a workflow function breaks replay correctness.

Two helpers address the most common non-determinism footguns:

- `ctx.is_replaying() -> bool` — returns `true` while the current call position still has a cached result in history. Use this to gate side effects (logging, tracing, metrics increments) that should only fire on live execution, not during replay.
- `ctx.workflow_start_time() -> DateTime<Utc>` — returns the original `WorkflowStarted` event timestamp, not `Utc::now()`. Use this instead of system time for any deadline or elapsed-time logic inside a workflow.

### Activity Retries

Activities retry with exponential backoff (default: 3 attempts, 1s base delay). Each failed attempt persists an `ActivityAttemptFailed` event (or `ActivityAttemptTimedOut` if a timeout was configured). After all retries are exhausted, `ActivityErrored` is written and the error propagates to the workflow. Activities are referenced by name string, not by passing a trait object.
